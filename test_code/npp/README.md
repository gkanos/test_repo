  Early development. Not usable.

## Description:
The New Pretty Printer is a fresh, visitor-based implementation of a pretty
printer for VDM. Its main purpose in Overture is to display the AST-based 
Proof Obligations to users.

This module is being developed to explore the following meta-goals:

* allow VDM language extensions to reuse the module with minimal changes
* provide extension mechanisms from multiple paragigms of programming (notably OO and Functional)
* provide a standard example for testing and documentation for Overture modules 

## Known Issues:
None
